# CAR-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
**Introduction**
A Car Recommendation System is an intelligent application that helps users find the most suitable car based on their needs, preferences, and budget.
With thousands of models, brands, and configurations available, buyers often struggle to find their perfect match.
 To solve this problem, machine learning techniques are used to analyze user preferences—such as budget, fuel type, mileage, seating capacity, brand, and performance—and compare them with a large dataset of available cars.
The system processes the user’s input, learns patterns from historical car data, and generates personalized recommendations. Instead of manually searching through thousands of options, users receive quick, accurate, and data-driven suggestions. This makes car selection easier, faster, and more reliable.
Machine learning models such as classification, clustering, or ranking algorithms enhance the system’s ability to predict the best match
